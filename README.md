# MCChatbot

Usage:

1. Extract it somewhere, make sure it has its own folder, otherwise your a file hoarder.
2. Get a Discord bot. Theres thousands of tutorials, all you need is your token.
2. Fill out the data in config.json.
  I. `token` is your discord bot token
  II. `listenid` is your discord id, so only you can use it to prevent others from abusing it
  III. `prefix` is what the bot will listen to when using commands
  IV. `email` and `password`, self-explanatory, email becomes username if you leave password blank when using the offline mode
3. Run `npm install` in the directory. It will take awhile.
4. Finally run `node index.js`
